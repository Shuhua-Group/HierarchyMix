# HierarchyMix
HierarchyMix is a software that can be used to reconstruct the 4-way admixture history considering the complex admixture structure. It could automatically select the optimal admixture model between the hierarchical admixture model and the sequential admixture model. HierarchyMix is an extension of the MultiWaver series software.

The usages of HierarchyMix can be found in HierarchyMix_manual.pdf
